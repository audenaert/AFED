This directory should be used to store servlet (and other web-based) 
configuration details. It should include the WEB-INF/ and META-INF/ 
directories needed to create a .war file. Note that the contents of 
these directories may be combined with other directories (e.g., 
/etc/jpa/META-INF) as needed to incorporate other resources. 

TODO We need to find a better mechanism for supporting different configurations
     that may require different sets of resources (e.g., the META-INF directory
     for a .war file as opposted to a .jar file).
